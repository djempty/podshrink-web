Your calendar is packed. Back-to-back meetings from 8 to 5. Strategy work in the margins. And somewhere in there, you're supposed to stay current on industry trends, competitive moves, and the ideas shaping your market.

Podcasts are one of the best sources for that kind of insight. Shows like [All-In](https://www.allinpodcast.co/), [Acquired](https://www.acquired.fm/), and [Invest Like the Best](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes) regularly surface ideas months before they hit mainstream business media.

The problem: those shows run 90 minutes to 3 hours each. Nobody with a real job has that kind of time.

## The Executive Podcast Problem

It's not that executives don't value podcasts. They do — [Edison Research](https://www.edisonresearch.com/) data shows podcast listening among professionals has grown 40% since 2020. The issue is pure time economics:

- **5 key industry podcasts** × 90 min avg = **7.5 hours/week**
- **Available listening time** (commute + gym) = **3-4 hours/week**
- **Gap:** 3-4 hours of missed content every single week

That gap compounds. After a month, you're 15+ hours behind. After a quarter, you've effectively stopped listening.

## The Briefing Approach

The best executives don't try to consume everything. They build systems that surface the most important information in the least time. Podcast consumption should work the same way.

### Step 1: Identify Your Must-Follow Shows

Pick 5-7 podcasts that directly impact your work. For most leaders, this includes:

- **One macro/market show** (All-In, Odd Lots, The Prof G Pod)
- **One industry-specific show** (depends on your sector)
- **One technology/innovation show** (a16z, Lex Fridman, Hard Fork)
- **One leadership/management show** (The Knowledge Project, Masters of Scale)
- **One wild card** (something outside your bubble that challenges your thinking)

### Step 2: Summarize Everything First

Run every new episode through [PodShrink](/). A 10-minute summary gives you the key arguments, data points, and takeaways from a 2-hour conversation.

This is your weekly briefing. Seven shows × 10 minutes = just over an hour. You can do that during Monday's commute.

### Step 3: Go Deep on What Matters

Maybe 1 in 5 summaries will make you think "I need to hear the full conversation." That's the episode you listen to in full — during a long drive, a flight, or a dedicated block.

The other 4? You got what you needed from the summary. No guilt, no backlog.

### Step 4: Share With Your Team

This is where summaries become a leadership tool. When you find an episode with ideas relevant to your team:

- Forward the summary link
- Add two sentences of context: "This is relevant because..."
- Use it as a discussion starter in your next meeting

You've just turned a 2-hour podcast into a 5-minute team knowledge transfer.

## The Compound Effect

Executives who stay current on industry conversations make better decisions. Not because they have more information, but because they have more context. They see patterns earlier. They reference ideas their competitors haven't heard yet.

A consistent podcast summary habit — 10 minutes a day, 5 days a week — keeps you in those conversations without sacrificing the time you need for actual work.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

**Monday morning:** Summarize the weekend's episodes (All-In, Acquired if new). Listen during commute. 30 minutes total.

**Wednesday:** Summarize midweek drops. Listen during lunch walk or gym. 20 minutes.

**Friday:** Catch any stragglers. Forward one standout summary to your team. 15 minutes.

**Total weekly time:** ~65 minutes for full coverage of 5-7 shows.

Compare that to 7.5 hours of full-episode listening. Same insights, 85% less time.

**Start your briefing:** [Browse shows](/shows) and summarize this week's episodes from your top 3 podcasts. You'll be caught up before lunch.
