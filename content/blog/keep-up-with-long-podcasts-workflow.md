You're not bad at keeping up with podcasts. They're just long.

Three hours with Huberman or Lex is great when you have it. Most days, you don't. The choice shouldn't be "skip it" or "lose an evening."

Here's the simple workflow that keeps you current without sacrificing time.

## Start With Intent, Not Guilt

Pick one episode you would actually listen to today if it were shorter. That's it. No backlog heroics. One link in, outcome out.

## Turn It Into a Summary

Drop the episode URL into [PodShrink](/). You'll get a tight, 10-minute summary — both text and audio. No fluff. Just the ideas.

## Use Your Commute or Errand Window

- Walk to coffee? Play the audio summary.
- Grocery run? Same.
- Between meetings? Read the text version.

You'll clear a "three-hour" episode in the margins of your day.

## Capture the One Thing

Every episode has one idea that's worth keeping. Save that line into your notes app. If you can't name it, you didn't miss much.

## Go Deeper Only When It's Worth It

If the summary hits, play the specific segment in the full episode. You don't need the whole thing — just the 12 minutes you now know to find.

## Make It a 10-Minute Habit

- **Morning:** turn one episode into a summary
- **Afternoon:** read or play it
- **Evening:** zero guilt

Consistency beats heroic bingeing.

## Use It With Your Stack

- **Read-later:** drop the text summary into Instapaper or Reader if you prefer reading
- **Calendar:** block a 10-minute "podcast" slot on weekdays
- **Sharing:** send a standout summary to your team with two bullet takeaways

## When This Works Best

- Depth shows ([Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/@hubaboratory), [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/), [a16z](https://a16z.com/podcasts/), [All-In](https://www.allinpodcast.co/))
- Weekly news roundups you can't keep up with
- Episodes you're "podcast-committed" to but rarely finish

## When to Skip

- Short episodes you can finish anyway
- Pure entertainment you want to enjoy uncompressed

## The Result

You'll stay current on the ideas that matter and stop pretending your queue is a to-do list. Three hours in, ten minutes out. That's the whole point.
