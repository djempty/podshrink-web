You pressed play 40 minutes ago. You've checked your phone twice, started a grocery list in your head, and realized you have no idea what the last segment was about. So you rewind. Listen again. Zone out again.

If this sounds familiar, you might have ADHD. Or you might just be human trying to sit through a 3-hour podcast. Either way, the result is the same: you stop listening before the good part.

## The Attention Tax on Long Content

ADHD affects [roughly 8-10% of adults](https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/), though many estimates suggest the real number is higher due to underdiagnosis. But attention challenges aren't exclusive to ADHD — they exist on a spectrum, and long-form audio content tests everyone's limits.

Here's what happens with a 2-hour podcast:

- **Minutes 1-15:** Engaged. New topic, fresh energy.
- **Minutes 15-30:** Still okay, maybe checking something on your phone.
- **Minutes 30-60:** Drifting. You catch fragments but miss connections.
- **Minutes 60+:** You're physically hearing words but mentally somewhere else entirely.

The episode might have brilliant insights at the 90-minute mark. You'll never get there — not because you don't care, but because your brain moved on.

## Why Summaries Work for ADHD Brains

Short-form content aligns with how ADHD brains actually process information:

### 1. Compressed Timeframe
A 10-minute summary fits inside your attention window. You can listen start-to-finish without the drift that kills longer sessions. The ideas land because you're present for all of them.

### 2. Higher Density
Summaries strip the filler — the long intros, the tangents, the repeated points. What's left is concentrated insight. ADHD brains thrive on high-stimulation, high-density content. A summary delivers exactly that.

### 3. Completion Feels Good
One of the hardest parts of ADHD is the guilt of unfinished things. A half-listened podcast joins the pile of half-read books and half-watched shows. Finishing a 10-minute summary gives your brain the dopamine hit of completion — and that feeling compounds.

### 4. Lower Barrier to Start
Starting a 3-hour episode is intimidating when you know you probably won't finish. Starting a 10-minute summary? Easy. You're more likely to press play, which means you're more likely to learn something.

## A System That Works

Here's a practical approach for ADHD listeners:

**Default to summaries.** Make the 10-minute version your first pass on every episode. This is your baseline — you'll always at least get this.

**Flag the good ones.** When a summary makes you think "I need to hear more about this," mark the full episode for a focused listening session. Save it for a long drive, a workout, or a dedicated block.

**Use audio, not text.** Reading summaries requires sustained visual focus — exactly the thing that's hard. Audio summaries let you listen while moving, cleaning, or fidgeting. Movement actually helps many people with ADHD maintain attention.

**Don't fight your brain.** If you zone out 5 minutes into a summary, that's fine. Replay it. At 10 minutes total, restarting costs almost nothing. Try restarting a 3-hour episode — that's when you give up for good.

## It's Not About Limitations

This isn't about accommodating a weakness. It's about being strategic with how your brain works.

Everyone has a finite attention budget. People with ADHD just have a more clearly defined one. Summaries are a tool for spending that budget wisely — getting the ideas that matter without burning through your focus on content that doesn't reward it.

The smartest listeners aren't the ones who finish every episode. They're the ones who absorb the most insight per minute of attention spent.
