Open your podcast app. Count the unplayed episodes.

If that number makes you feel guilty, you're not alone. The average podcast listener subscribes to 8 shows. Most of those shows release weekly. That's 8+ hours of new content every seven days — and it never stops.

This isn't a discipline problem. It's a math problem. And the solution isn't "listen harder."

## Why Your Queue Keeps Growing

Podcast apps are designed like to-do lists. Every new episode shows up as an unplayed item, silently judging you. Miss a week and you're 8 episodes behind. Miss a month and you've mentally given up.

The problem is that we treat every episode equally. A 3-hour deep dive on geopolitics gets the same weight as a 20-minute news recap. Your brain sees them as identical tasks, so it avoids all of them.

## The Triage System

Hospital emergency rooms don't treat patients in the order they arrive. They triage — assess urgency and allocate attention accordingly. Your podcast queue needs the same approach.

### Tier 1: Must-Listen (Full Episodes)
These are the shows you genuinely love. The ones where the host's voice feels like a conversation with a friend. You'd be disappointed to miss them.

**Rule:** Listen to these in full. Limit yourself to 2-3 shows max.

### Tier 2: Want the Ideas (Summaries)
These are shows with great content but you don't need every word. You want the insights, the arguments, the takeaways — not the 20-minute intro or the repeated disclaimers.

**Rule:** [Summarize these](/shows). A 10-minute summary captures the substance. If something sounds incredible, you can always go back to the full episode.

### Tier 3: Occasional Interest (Scan and Skip)
These are shows you subscribed to during a phase. Maybe you were into true crime for a month, or someone recommended a business podcast you never got into.

**Rule:** Unsubscribe. Seriously. You can always come back. Keeping them in your feed just adds visual noise and guilt.

## How to Actually Implement This

**Step 1:** Open your podcast app right now. Sort your subscriptions into the three tiers. Be ruthless with Tier 3 — unsubscribe from anything you haven't listened to in a month.

**Step 2:** For Tier 2 shows, set up [PodShrink](/) summaries. Every time a new episode drops, run a 10-minute summary instead of queuing the full 2-hour episode.

**Step 3:** Schedule your listening. Block specific times — commute, workout, chores. Don't try to "find time." Assign time.

**Step 4:** Accept that you'll miss things. This is the hardest part. You cannot listen to everything. Nobody can. The goal is to consistently consume the most valuable content, not all content.

## The Math After Triage

Let's say you have 10 subscriptions:
- **3 Tier 1 shows** × 60 min average = 3 hours/week (full listen)
- **5 Tier 2 shows** × 10 min summary = 50 min/week (summarized)
- **2 Tier 3 shows** = unsubscribed, 0 min/week

**Total: ~4 hours/week** instead of 10+. You're consuming content from 8 shows in less than half the time, and you actually feel caught up.

## The Guilt Goes Away

The real benefit isn't time saved — it's the psychological relief. When your queue is manageable, you stop avoiding it. When you stop avoiding it, you actually enjoy podcasts again.

Podcast overload isn't about having too many podcasts. It's about not having a system. Now you do.
