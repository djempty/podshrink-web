Running a company doesn't leave much time for learning. But the founders who stay sharp are the ones who keep absorbing ideas — from investors, operators, and builders who've been where they're going.

Podcasts are one of the best channels for that. The conversations are deeper than blog posts, more current than books, and you can listen while doing other things.

Here are 10 shows worth your time in 2026, why each one matters, and how to consume them without sacrificing your schedule.

## 1. All-In Podcast

**Hosts:** Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, David Friedberg
**Avg length:** 90-120 min | **Frequency:** Weekly

Four billionaire investors argue about markets, politics, tech, and each other. It's unfiltered, opinionated, and consistently ahead of the news cycle. If you only follow one show for macro trends, this is it.

**Why summarize:** The banter is entertaining but the signal is in about 30 minutes of the 90. A summary extracts the market takes and skips the poker stories.

## 2. Acquired

**Hosts:** Ben Gilbert & David Rosenthal
**Avg length:** 2-4 hours | **Frequency:** Bi-weekly

The most thoroughly researched business podcast. Each episode is a complete history of a company — how it was built, what decisions mattered, and what you can learn from it. Past episodes cover NVIDIA, Costco, Hermès, and more.

**Why summarize:** At 3+ hours, most people never finish an episode. A summary gives you the key strategic lessons. Save the full listen for the companies most relevant to your industry.

## 3. The Tim Ferriss Show

**Host:** Tim Ferriss
**Avg length:** 90-120 min | **Frequency:** 2x/week

Ferriss interviews world-class performers across every discipline. The episodes are packed with frameworks, routines, and tactics. The archive alone is a masterclass library.

**Why summarize:** Two episodes per week at 90+ minutes each is 3 hours of content. Summaries help you triage — find the guests most relevant to your current challenges.

## 4. My First Million

**Hosts:** Shaan Puri & Sam Parr
**Avg length:** 45-60 min | **Frequency:** 3x/week

Business ideas, breakdowns of companies making millions in unexpected ways, and honest conversations about what it takes to build. Shorter episodes but high frequency means they pile up fast.

**Why summarize:** Three episodes per week. Even at 45 minutes each, that's over 2 hours. Summaries keep you current without the backlog.

## 5. Lenny's Podcast

**Host:** Lenny Rachitsky
**Avg length:** 60-90 min | **Frequency:** Weekly

The go-to show for product managers and growth leaders. Guests include product leaders from Airbnb, Figma, Notion, and Stripe. Deep, tactical conversations about building products people love.

**Why summarize:** If you're not in product, you can extract the growth and strategy insights in 10 minutes. If you are in product, use the summary to decide which episodes deserve the full listen.

## 6. The Knowledge Project

**Host:** Shane Parrish
**Avg length:** 60-90 min | **Frequency:** Weekly

Mental models, decision-making frameworks, and leadership principles. Parrish's interviews consistently surface ideas that change how you think — not just what you know.

**Why summarize:** Every episode has 2-3 core insights. A summary captures those without the extended exploration around them.

## 7. How I Built This

**Host:** Guy Raz
**Avg length:** 45-60 min | **Frequency:** Weekly

Origin stories of great companies, told by their founders. Airbnb, Spanx, Instagram, Dyson — the struggles, pivots, and breakthroughs that built them.

**Why summarize:** Great for inspiration and pattern recognition. A summary gives you the key decisions and turning points from each story.

## 8. 20VC

**Host:** Harry Stebbings
**Avg length:** 30-45 min | **Frequency:** 3x/week

Venture capital and startup strategy. Stebbings interviews the biggest names in VC — insights on fundraising, scaling, and what investors actually look for.

**Why summarize:** Short episodes but three per week. Summaries let you scan all three and deep-dive on the most relevant one.

## 9. Invest Like the Best

**Host:** Patrick O'Shaughnessy
**Avg length:** 60-90 min | **Frequency:** Weekly

Conversations with investors, founders, and business thinkers about what makes great businesses work. More analytical and framework-heavy than most shows.

**Why summarize:** High density. Every episode has usable frameworks. A summary distills them into something you can actually apply.

## 10. Masters of Scale

**Host:** Reid Hoffman
**Avg length:** 30-45 min | **Frequency:** Weekly

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman explores how companies grow from zero to massive scale. Unique narrative format with real founder interviews woven through.

**Why summarize:** Already shorter, but the narrative format means key insights are spread throughout. A summary pulls them together.

## How to Consume All 10

If you tried to listen to all 10 shows in full, you'd need roughly 12-15 hours per week. That's a part-time job.

With summaries:
- **10 shows × 10-minute summary = ~100 minutes/week**
- Pick 2-3 full episodes that earned it = 3-4 hours
- **Total: ~5 hours for complete coverage of 10 shows**

That's the difference between falling behind and staying ahead.
