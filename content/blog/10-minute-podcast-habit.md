I used to have a podcast problem. Not the fun kind where you discover amazing shows. The guilt kind, where you stare at 30 unplayed episodes and feel like a failure.

Every Sunday night, I'd tell myself "this week I'll catch up." By Wednesday, three more episodes had dropped and I was further behind than before.

Then I changed one thing. It took 10 minutes a day, and within a week my queue was at zero.

## The Habit

Every morning, before I leave the house, I pick one episode from yesterday's drops and turn it into a 10-minute summary.

That's it. One episode. Ten minutes. Every day.

I listen to the summary during my morning coffee or on the walk to work. By the time I sit down at my desk, I've absorbed the key ideas from a 2-hour episode without carving out 2 hours.

## Why 10 Minutes Works

**It's small enough to never skip.** Two hours is a commitment. Ten minutes is nothing. You can do it while brushing your teeth, making breakfast, or waiting for the bus. The barrier is so low that skipping feels harder than doing it.

**It compounds fast.** One episode per day = 7 per week = 30 per month. That's more episodes than most people consume in full — and you're doing it in the margins of your day.

**It removes decision fatigue.** "Which 3-hour episode should I commit to today?" is a hard question. "Which episode should I summarize in 10 minutes?" is easy. You just pick one.

## How I Set It Up

### Step 1: Pick Your 5-7 Shows

I chose the shows I care about most but consistently fall behind on. For me, that's [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/), [Huberman Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab), [All-In](https://www.allinpodcast.co/), and a few industry-specific shows.

### Step 2: Morning Check

Each morning, I check what dropped in the last 24 hours. Usually 1-2 new episodes. I pick the one that interests me most.

### Step 3: Summarize

I drop the episode into [PodShrink](/) and choose a 10-minute summary. It generates in under 2 minutes. I hit play and go about my morning.

### Step 4: Flag or Move On

If the summary makes me think "I need the full version," I save the episode for a long drive or workout. Maybe 1 in 5 episodes earns that treatment. The other 4? I got what I needed.

## What Changed

**Week 1:** I was skeptical. Summarizing felt like cheating. But I was current on all my shows for the first time in months.

**Week 2:** I started looking forward to the morning summary. It became my "podcast coffee" — a quick intellectual warm-up before the day.

**Week 3:** I realized I was actually retaining more. When you listen to a focused 10-minute summary, you remember the key points. When you half-listen to a 3-hour episode while multitasking, you remember almost nothing.

**Month 1:** My queue hit zero and stayed there. I unsubscribed from 4 shows I realized I didn't actually care about — the summaries made that obvious.

## The Surprising Side Effects

**Better conversations.** I started referencing podcast ideas in meetings and with friends. Not because I was listening more, but because the summaries distilled ideas into memorable, quotable points.

**Less guilt.** The unplayed episodes badge was a constant low-grade stress. Gone.

**More full listens, not fewer.** Counter-intuitively, I listen to more full episodes now. The summaries help me identify which episodes are genuinely worth 2-3 hours. Before, I'd randomly pick one and often bail halfway through.

## The Anti-Hack

This isn't a productivity hack. It's not about optimizing every minute or consuming more content. It's about removing the friction between you and the ideas you want to hear.

Ten minutes. One episode. Every morning. The queue takes care of itself.

**Start tomorrow:** [Browse shows](/shows) and bookmark one show you've been falling behind on. Tomorrow morning, summarize the latest episode. Do it for a week and see what happens.
